Language name: RUTUL
Language number: 2603
Alternate names: 
Classification: Caucasian, Northwest
Comments: Rutul is spoken in the Upper Samur river basin 
in the Dagestan ASSR and in adjoining areas of Azerbaijan, 
USSR. Ibragimov (1978) argues for pharyngealization as a 
feature of uvular and laryngeal consonants, rather than 
positing a set of pharyngealized vowels (cf. 
Dzhejranishvili 1967) which would be contrastive only in 
the context of uvulars. However his "pharyngealized 
laryngeals" have been interpreted as primary pharyngeal 
consonants. Labialized sibilant fricatives and affricates 
are rare but seem authentic. The missing cases (eg. dzw) 
may well be gaps in the data rather than absent from the 
language.
