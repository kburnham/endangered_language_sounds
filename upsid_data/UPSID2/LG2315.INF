Language name: NYAH KUR
Language number: 2315
Alternate names: Chao Bon
Classification: Austro-Asiatic, Mon
Comments: Nyah Kur is spoken in Thailand in some 
communities along the eastern margin of the Central Plain 
(Chao Praya basin). It has a "register" system involving 
primarily phonation contrasts, represented here as a 
plain/breathy distinction in vowels. All vowels may appear 
long and short. A final consonant described by Diffloth 
(1984) as "an s-like sound" and transcribed as a voiceless 
palatal approximant has been interpreted as a palatal 
fricative. Thongkum (1984) transcribes it as a devoiced 
palatal stop, but it contrasts with /-c/.
