Khmer syllables are assigned to one of two 
'registers'.  Vowel qualities often differ between 
registers with some being limited to one or the other.  In 
careful speech lower pitch and breathy phonation 
distinguish second from first register, but often only 
vowel differences remain in more rapid speech.  In 
addition to the short diphthongs listed there are a number 
of vowel sequences.
