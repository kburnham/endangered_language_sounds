Language name: NAXI
Language number: 2525
Alternate names: Nakhi, Nahsi, Moso
Classification: Sino-Tibetan, Lolo-Burmese
Comments: Lijiang dialect.  Naxi is spoken in Northwestern 
Yunnan, China, primarily around Lijiang.  The fricative 
vowel contrasts with /u/; it has a bilabial trill 
allophone after bilabial consonants.  High vowels /i,u,y/ 
occur before a number of non-high vowels; the 11 resulting 
sequences might be regarded as diphthongs.  Naxi has 4 
tones, high, mid, low rising, and low falling.  Bradley 
(1975) suggests that the rising tone only occurs in loan 
vocabulary.
