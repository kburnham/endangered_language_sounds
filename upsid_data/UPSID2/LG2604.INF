Language name: BATS
Language number: 2604
Alternate names: Batsbij
Classification: Caucasian, Caucasian
Comments: Bats is spoken in the Akhmetsk region of 
northern Georgia, USSR. Nasalized vowels only occur in a 
few inflectional endings but contrast with vowel + nasal. 
Desheriev (1953) also notes 3 long vowels but at least 
some examples are clearly just juxtapositions of two 
separate vowels. Similarly the diphthongs he reports seem 
to be a sequence of two adjacent vowels. Especially 
restricted are the "nasalized diphthongs" which all end in 
nasalized 'i' and occur only in inflectional endings.
