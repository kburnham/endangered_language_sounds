Language number: 2415
Alternate names: 
Classification: Austro-Tai, W. Malayo-Polynesian
Comments: Sa'ban is spoken in the northeast on Sarawak 
border, South of Lundayeh in Kalimantan, Indonesia.
All vowels have long and short forms, which 
contrast in closed syllables. Except for /a/ long vowels 
are usually pronounced with an offglide to schwa. 
Morphological patterns suggest that the quite large number 
of complex syllable onsets (hm, bw, mb, etc.) should be 
treated as sequences.
