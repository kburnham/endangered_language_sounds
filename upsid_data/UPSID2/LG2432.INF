Language name: LAI
Language number: 2432
Alternate names: Li
Classification: Austro-Tai, Li-Kam-Tai
Comments: The dialect reported here is spoken in Lunglin 
County Guangxi Province, China and described by Liang 
(1984 a,b). Ouyang and Zheng (1985) describe the variety 
of Lai spoken in southern Yunnan. It is sometimes unclear 
if the differences in reported consonant and vowel systems 
reflect different interpretations or real differences 
between the dialects. Liang's "?j, ?v, hj, hv" have been 
interpreted as laryngealized and voiceless approximants 
but these could indicate secondary features accompanying 
glottal stop and h. Liang's palatalized forms contrast 
before front vowels. All vowels can be long or short 
including in cases where there is an [i] or [u] offglide. 
These glides are interpreted as final allophones of 
initial (laryngealized) /j, w/, and the vowels are 
interpreted as geminate when long, i.e. [o:u] = /oow/, 
[a:i} = /aaj/. However [a] in closed syllables appears in 
three lengths, hence is assumed to have underlying length 
contrast. The three lengths are therefore single /a/ long 
/a:/and geminate /aa/, Liang reports 6 tones - 3 levels, 
high falling, low falling, low rising.
