Language name: Cham
Language number: 2411
Alternate names: 
Classification: Austro-Tai, W. Malayo-Polynesian
Comments: Cham is spoken mostly in Kampuchea but there are 
several speakers in Vietnam.
Retroflex stops and fricatives occur and are 
interpreted by Blood (1967) as clusters of alveolars with 
/r/ even though the main allophone of /r/ is an alveolar 
flap. However, other obstruents occur in clusters with /r/ 
and there is a gap for /tr/ etc. Laryngealized /b,d/ vary 
with plain voiced [b,d]. Cham has a two-level tone system.
