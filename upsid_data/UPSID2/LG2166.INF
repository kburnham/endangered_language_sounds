Language name: Khalkha
Language number: 2166
Alternate names: Mongolian
Classification: Ural-Altaic, Mongolian
Comments: Khalkha is spoken primarily in Mongolia People's 
Republic but there are few speakers in USSR.
All simple vowels appear both long and short.  
Khalkha Mongolian has a vowel harmony system probably 
based on pharyngeal cavity size (Svantesson 1985).  /i, u, 
e, o/ have expanded pharynx ([+ATR]), though /i/ is 
neutral to vowel harmony in non-initial syllables.  /g/ 
and /x/ are treated as allophones by Hangin (1968).  
Treatment of diphthongs is varied in sources.
