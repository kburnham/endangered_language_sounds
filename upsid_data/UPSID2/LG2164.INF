Classification: Ural-Altaic, Samoyed
Comments: Tym dialect.  Selkup is spoken in Siberia in an 
area south of the Khatanga Gulf.  The source is an 
interpretation of older sources by Katz and may be 
incomplete.  Several aspects of the transcription are 
obscure.  Katz recognizes a set of labialized consonants 
which are omitted from UPSID.  They could be analyzed as C 
+ w.
