Language name: BRAO
Language number: 2311
Alternate names: Lave
Classification: Austro-Asiatic, Bahnaric
Comments: Brao is spoken in an area of North-Eastern 
Cambodia and adjoining areas of Laos.  Keller (1976) 
provides details of the pronunciation of the symbols used 
in a 'practical orthography' but no other information on 
the phonology.  Sequences of two like vowels represent 
long vowels; all may appear long.  Sequences of unlike 
vowels may be limited but the limits are not specified.  
Approximants may follow long vowels.
