Language name: IRARUTU
Language number: 2440
Alternate names: Irutu
Classification: Austro-Tai, Eastern Malayo-Polynesian
Comments: Fruata dialect.  Irarutu is spoken in the center 
of the Bomberai peninsula, Irian Jaya, Indonesia.  
Voorhoeve (1989) reports that "stress is phonemic" but 
"usually is on the last vowel" of a word.  A /p/ occurs 
only in a few clearly recognizable Indonesian loans, hence 
is not included in the inventory.  A predictable schwa 
vowel occurs after utterance-final consonants and between 
adjoining consonants not separated by a lexical vowel.  
Prenasalized stops or the bilabial fricative before /r/ do 
not require insertion of schwa.
