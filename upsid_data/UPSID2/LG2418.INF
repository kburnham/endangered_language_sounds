Classification: Austro-Tai, Tsouic
Comments: Tsou is spoken on the western side of Mt. Ali in 
Taiwan.  Vowel sequences are common but can be analyzed as 
heterosyllabic.  Stress generally falls on the penultimate 
syllable.  The laryngealized segments are described as 
"preglottalized"; the laryngealized lateral is distinct 
from the sequence /?l/ but /?b/ is not reported by Tung 
(1964).
