Comments: Vietnamese is spoken primarily in Vietnam.
Vietnamese (of Hanoi) has six tones 
distinguished by level, contour and laryngeal features.  
/p/ only occurs finally and can be analyzed as an 
allophone of implosive /b/, but no general rule that 
voiced initials pair with voiceless final stops can be 
formulated.  Vowels in open syllables are followed by a 
consonantal offglide (/j/ after /i, e/ etc.).  /j, w/ can 
follow most vowels, when no other consonant may appear, 
but some final consonants can follow the diphthongs with a 
low final element.
