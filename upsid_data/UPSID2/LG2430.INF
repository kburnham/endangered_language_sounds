Language name: POHNPEIAN
Language number: 2430
Alternate names: Ponapean
Classification: Austro-Tai, Eastern Malayo-Polynesian
Comments: Main dialect.  Pohnpeian is spoken in Pohnpei, 
Federated States of Micronesia.  A higher mid front vowel 
[e] occurs when a high vowel or glide follows in 
underlying forms.  Surface contrasts arise with the lower 
mid front vowel (Rehg 1984).  All vowels can appear long, 
often as a result of compensatory lengthening.
