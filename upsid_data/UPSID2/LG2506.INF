Language name: BAI
Language number: 2506
Alternate names: Minkia, Minjia
Classification: Sino-Tibetan, Sinitic
Comments: Bai is spoken primarily in the Dali Bai 
autonomous county in western Yunnan, China.  Dell (1981) 
notes 8 tones: high, mid and low level, high falling and 
low falling, mid rising and low fall-rise -- the 8th tone 
is very high with a final glottal stop which shortens the 
vowel.  Since no initial glottal stops occur this feature 
is analyzed as part of an extra high tone.  There are no 
final consonants.  /j,w/ can appear after some consonants, 
as well as initially.  /w/ has a labial-palatal variant 
before /i/.  The labio-dental fricative vowel does not 
occur after bilabials.
