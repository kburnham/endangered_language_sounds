Comments: Phlong is spoken in the Irrawaddy Delta and 
northern Tenasserim areas of Myanmar (Burma) and in 
southwestern Chiang Mai, Thailand.  Phlong has four tones 
on main syllables: high, mid, low and falling.  Syllables 
with final glottal stop may only have high (which rises in 
this environment) or falling tone.  Final velar nasal 
often surfaces as nasalization of the end of the vowel, 
sometimes with a raised offglide.
