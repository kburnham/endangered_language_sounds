Language name: SAAMI
Language number: 2155
Alternate names: Lappish
Classification: Ural-Altaic, Finno-Ugric, Finnic
Comments: There are complex interrelations between vowels 
and consonants.  Long and diphthongal realizations of 
vowels appear to be predictable if palatalization of 
consonants is taken as distinctive.  Consonants can appear 
geminate and in many clusters, particularly with /h/.  The 
Southern dialect described by Hassselbrink (1965) has been 
interpreted in the light of the more phonetically detailed 
but less phonological description of an Eastern dialect by 
Kert (1971).
