Comments: Boumaa dialect.  Boumaa Fijian is spoken around 
'Orovou on Taveuni, Fiji.  All vowels may occur long.  
Long vowels and diphthongs attract stress; primary stress 
goes on the syllable containing the penultimate mora in 
Dixon's formulation.  /k/ occurs in loans from Standard 
Fijian, Tongan, and English; /f/ in loans from English and 
Tongan.
