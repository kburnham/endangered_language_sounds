Language name: KHMU?
Language number: 2312
Alternate names: Kammu
Classification: Austro-Asiatic, Palaungic
Comments: Khmu? is spoken in Burma, Laos, Thailand, 
Vietman and China.
(Northern) Khmu? has a two-level tone system.  
Aspirated plosives might be interpreted as Ch clusters 
(Svantesson's 'deep phonology' does so) but only a few 
words provide clear motivation for such an interpretation.
