Language name: SAMA
Language number: 2412
Alternate names: Bajo, Bajau
Classification: Austro-Tai, W. Malayo-Polynesian
Comments: Sama is spoken in the Capul Island near San 
Bernadino Strait, northwest Samar in the phillipines.
All vowels except schwa occur long and short and 
all consonants except /h/ and /?/ may appear geminate.  
Long vowels do not occur before geminates.  Since 
prenasalized consonants can be geminated and permit a long 
vowel to precede they are treated as single consonants.  
Verheijen's final diphthongs /ai,au/ are interpreted as 
/aj,aw/.
