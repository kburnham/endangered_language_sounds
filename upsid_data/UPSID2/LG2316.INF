Language name: BRUU
Language number: 2316
Alternate names: Brou
Classification: Austro-Asiatic, Katuic
Comments: Western dialect.  W. Bruu is spoken in areas of 
Savannehkhet province, Laos and Ubon Rachathani province, 
Thailand.  The 'register' distinction between plain and 
breathy voice quality is localized in the vowels in this 
interpretation.  Aspirated or voiced stops do not occur 
before breathy vowels, neither does /s/.  The inital 
("minor") syllable of disyllabic words does not have 
plain/breathy contrast.  Vowels are nasalized rather than 
breathy in phonologically "breathy" syllables after /h/ 
and /?/.
