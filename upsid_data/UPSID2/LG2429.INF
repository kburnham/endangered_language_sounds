Language name: MOR
Language number: 2429
Alternate names: 
Classification: Austro-Tai, Eastern Malayo-Polynesian
Comments: Mor is spoken on the Mor and Mamboor islands in 
the Southwest of Geelvink Bay, Inan Jaya, Indonesia. The 
prenasalized stops shown here only occur medially and at 
least some instances derive from a nasal + /v/, /r/ or 
/t/, and /?/, but other words seem to have basic 
prenasalized stops. Because clusters are otherwise absent, 
a case can be made for considering these as unit phonemes. 
Laycock reports there is a tonal system "which has not 
been fully analyzed". He notes high and low tones and 
leaves some syllables unmarked implying possibly a third 
(mid) level.
