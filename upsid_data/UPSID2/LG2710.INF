Language name: ITELMEN
Language number: 2710
Alternate names: Kamchadal
Classification: Chukchi-Kamchatkan
Comments: Itelmen is spoken by some older speakers on the 
west coast of the Kamchatka peninsula, USSR.  Volodin 
(1976) describes a limited vowel harmony system based on 
height, /i,u/ -> /e,o/ and /e/ -> /a/ when a low(er) vowel 
follows.  Glottal stop is largely found at morpheme 
boundaries.  Several phonetic descriptions are vague; /a/ 
may be central or front, the lateral fricatives might not 
be actually fricative, the alveolar ejective affricate 
might be be palato-alveolar (it is described as 
contrasting with /tS/ by being non-palatalized).
