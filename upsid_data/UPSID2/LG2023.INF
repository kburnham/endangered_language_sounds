Language name: NEPALI
Language number: 2023
Alternate names: 
Classification: Indo-European, Indic
Comments: Nearly all sequences of the six oral vowels are 
reported; syllabification of such sequences seems to be 
variable.  Nasalized nonlow vowels are less clearly 
contrastive than the low one -- some words show variation 
between final nasalized vowel and final nasal consonant.
