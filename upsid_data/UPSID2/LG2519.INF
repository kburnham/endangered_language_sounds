Language name: HMONG
Language number: 2519
Alternate names: Miao
Classification: Sino-Tibetan, Hmong-Mien
Comments: Dananshan dialect, Xianjin Xiang, Guizhou. Miao 
dialects are spoken in quite widely scattered areas of 
Hunan, Hubei, Guizhou, Guangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan in China 
and in northern parts of Thailand, Laos and Vietnam. The 
dialect represented here is described in the Miao Language 
Team article (1962) and by Wang (1983, 1985). It is 
described with 8 tones, transcribed on the Chinese 5-point 
scale as 55, 44, 33, 43, 31, 24, 21, 13. Aspirated stops, 
voiceless nasals and voiceless fricatives only occur with 
the first 4 tones in this list. Unaspirated stops, voiced 
nasals and voiced fricatives occur with all eight tones 
but become breathy voiced ("voiced aspirates") with the 
last two tones (low-fall and low rise). An alternative 
analysis might add breathy voiced segments to the 
consonant inventory and reduce the number of tones but the 
consonants undergo an alternation when tone sandhi results 
in the 13 tone replacing another tone. Hence breathy 
voicing is treated as an attribute of these tones. /l/ 
clusters with labial stops and with /t/ and /th/ 
initially. Native words seem to have mostly simple 
vocalism but more complex vowel nuclei have been borrowed 
from Chinese. Only dental and velar nasals occur as 
syllable final consonants.
