Smith reports highly restricted nasalized 
vowels, after /h,?/ only.  There are complex relationships 
between laryngealization of vowels, allowable final 
consonants and vowel diphthongization.  In closed 
syllables, laryngealized vowels occur only before /j,w/ 
and nasals.  These syllables could be interpreted as 
terminating with laryngealized consonants, but in open 
syllables plain and laryngealized vowels contrast and both 
differ from final -? and -h syllables.
