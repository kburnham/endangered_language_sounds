Classification: Sino-Tibetan, Himalayic
Comments: Kathmandu dialect. Newari is spoken in the 
Kathmandu valley of Nepal. The reduced vowel inventory 
proposed by Hale and Hale (1969) has been accepted. 
Surface vowels of other qualities result from coalescence 
in vowel sequences. /i, u/ are desyllabified before low 
vowels, and merge elsewhere.
