Language name: Lue
Language number: 2427
Alternate names: Li
Classification: Austro-Tai, Li-Kam-Tai
Comments: Lue is spoken in southern Yunnan, China, near 
the common border of Myanmar (Burma) and Laos. The 
language has six tones; high, mid and low level, mid-high 
and low-mid rising, high falling. Vowels in syllables 
closed by /p t k ?/ are short and these syllables may only 
have H or M tone. Final [w] (found after unrounded vowels 
only) is treated as an allophone of /v/. Final /j/ occurs 
after non-front vowels only. Morev (1978) lists one 
affricate (apparently [ts] at least before non-front 
vowels); Li (1964) lists aspirated and unaspirated 
"pre-palatal" affricates. Morev considers /kw, khw/ units, 
Li (1964) treats them as initial clusters.
