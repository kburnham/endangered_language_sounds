Language name: MOGHOL
Language number: 2174
Alternate names: 
Classification: Ural-Altaic, Mongolian
Comments: Moghol is spoken by older people in a couple of 
villages near Herat, Afghanistan. The voiced 
palato-alveolar affricate is described as a voiced stop 
followed by a voicedless fricative - this seems unlikely.
