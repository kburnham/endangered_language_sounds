Comments: Japanese is spoken primarily in Japan.
All vowels may appear long, as may all 
obstruents  - long vowels accent placement may be on 
either element.  Shibatani (1990) reports final nasals as 
uvulars, varying with the nasalized counterpart of the 
preceding vowel.  /t, d, s, z/ are replaced by 
palato-alveolar affricates or fricatives before /i, e/. 
/t, d/ are [ts, dz] before /u/.  Some analyses regard 
these sibilant variants as phonemic because of a residue 
of problematic cases.  Bloch (1950) and Horne (1963) both 
report that /t, d, n, s/ are dental before /a/; this 
variant is taken as underlying.
