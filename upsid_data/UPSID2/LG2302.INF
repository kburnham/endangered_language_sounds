Bengal in India and also in Bangaldesh.
All vowels occur short and long but long vowels 
are limited in distribution.  /ia/ patterns like a short 
vowel, /ie, uo/ like long vowels.  Final /w/ and /j/ 
exclude any other final consonant and hence are treated as 
consonantal offglides rather than as constituents of 
diphthongs.
