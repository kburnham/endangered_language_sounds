Comments: Archi is spoken in mountainous areas of the 
southern Dagestan ASSR, in the Soviet Union. Kodzasov 
(1977) treats pharyngealization as a 'suprasegmental' 
element which can be focussed on a vowel or a uvular 
consonant. Particularly in the latter case it seems 
preferable to treat it as segmental. Originally only velar 
and uvular consonants (and the long lateral fricative ?) 
had contrastive labialization but there are now a few 
words with distinctive labialization on most of the 
dental/alveolar or palato-alveolar obstruents. The voiced 
lateral fricative arises from morphological combination of 
a lateral ejective and a dental/alveolar stop but surface 
contrasts occur with other laterals.
