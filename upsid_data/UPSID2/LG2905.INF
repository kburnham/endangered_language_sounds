Language name: KOYA
Language number: 2905
Alternate names: 
Classification: Dravidian, Dravidian
Comments: Gommu dialect.  All consonants except /h/ occur 
geminate and all vowels appear long and short.  The 
retroflex consonants are not the sublaminal type found 
most commonly in Dravidian languages but are apical 
postalveolar.  Tyler's vowel descriptions seem sometimes 
at variance with the choice of symbols for transcription: 
the low back vowel might be rounded.
