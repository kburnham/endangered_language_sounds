Language name: KASHMIRI
Language number: 2018
Alternate names: 
Classification: Indo-European, Indic
Comments: Most Kashmiri consonants in final position may 
occur with distinctive palatal, central or back (rounded) 
releases.  Zakharin (1974) sets up separate series of 
palatalized and labialized consonants to account for 
these.  Bhat (1987) interprets these releases as resulting 
from diphthongs preceding the consonants.  The solution 
preferred here is to treat these as instances of the short 
high vowels.  Nasalized vowels occur only in medial 
position.
