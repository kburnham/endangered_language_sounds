Alternate names: 
Classification: Austro-Tai, W. Malayo-Polynesian
Comments: Southern Ivatan dialect.  Ivatan is spoken  on 
the islands of the Batanes province of the Philippines 
relatively close to Taiwan. The palato-alveolar segments 
historically derive from velars and are mostly still found 
before /i/ where velars do not occur. If an underlying /i/ 
is posited for the remaining cases these segments can be 
eliminated.
