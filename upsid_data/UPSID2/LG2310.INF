Vowel length and pitch are interdependent, low 
tone vowels being long.  Manley treats length as 
conditioning low pitch but the reverse assumption is 
preferred here.  What are described as "aspirated nasals" 
are interpreted as voiceless nasals but the phrase might 
be intended to mean "breathy voiced".  They are written 
mh, nh, etc., by Manley.
