Language name: KONKANI
Language number: 2024
Alternate names: 
Classification: Indo-European, Indic
Comments: Konkani is spoken in Goa, Southern Kannada and 
parts of Mysore (?). The version represented here is 
essentially that in Madtha (1984). Other accounts of the 
language include sets of voiceless and voiced aspirates 
which appear to be spelling pronunciations, though /f/ 
often reflects orthographic 'ph'. All vowels have long 
counterparts. Stress is usually initial.
