Language name: KORYAK
Language number: 2709
Alternate names: 
Classification: Chukchi-Kamchatkan
Comments: Koryak is spoken by a few hundred people on the 
Kamchatka peninsula in the USSR.  A vowel harmony process 
requires vowels in a word to belong to set 1 (i,u,e) or 
set 2 (e,o,a).  Many transcriptions are given with a schwa 
vowel in Zhukova (1980) but their origin is not explained.  
Palatal laterals occur before most vowels but are 
described as "palatalized variants" of /l/.  From the data 
available they appear contrastive.  All consonants except 
/?/ can appear geminated.
