Comments: Zhanglu dialect.  Kam is spoken in an area 
overlapping the shared borders of Guizhou, Guangxi, and 
Hunan provinces of China.  There are 9 tones in 
non-checked syllables; 6 of these are level or falling 
(55, 11, 323, 31, 53, 33).  The other 3 have rising onsets 
(35, 13, 453) and condition aspiration in stop-initial 
syllables (including /?/).  Six tones occur in checked 
syllables, of which two (35, 13) condition aspiration.  
Checked tones 55, 35, 21 are short and checked tones 323, 
13, 31 are long.  The raised low and mid central vowels 
only occur with a coda (nasal or stop after mid central, 
nasal or glide after low central).  /j/ occurs after low 
or back vowels, /w/ after low or front vowels.
