Language name: TETUN
Language number: 2437
Alternate names: Timorese
Classification: Austro-Tai, Central Malayo-Polynesian
Comments: Tetun is spoken on the island of Timor around 
Dili and in two separate areas to the east and west.  
Morris (1984) is a linguistically unsophisticated source 
with some especially confusing remarks about vowel 
sequences. More sequences occur in the dictionary than are 
listed in the introduction; probably all pairs of vowels 
occur. /w/ might be analyzed as a prevocalic variant of 
/u/, as Morris proposes, but there is no parallel to this 
with /i/. Stress is normally penultimate except a few 
items stressed on the final syllable.
