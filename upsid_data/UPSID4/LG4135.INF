Language name: KPAN
Language number: 4135
Alternate names: 
Classification: Niger-Kordofanian, Jukunoid
Comments: A number of consonants analyzed by Shimizu as Cw 
and Cj clusters have been included as single segments here 
since they are phonetically single segments.  Prenasalized 
stops occur only before oral vowels; plain nasals occur 
before nasalized vowels and these are regarded as 
allophones of the prenasalized stops.  Kpan has 3 level 
tones.
