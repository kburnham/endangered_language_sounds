Language name: YAWA
Language number: 8629
Alternate names: Yava
Classification: Papuan, Geelvink Bay
Comments: Yawa is spoken on Yapen island, Irian Jaya, 
Indonesia. Stress placement is unpredictable. After /u/ 
the palato-alveolar affricate has the allophone [g]. Nasal 
+ obstruent clusters occur but Jones (1986) reports that 
they are not homorganic if the obstruent is velar or 
palato-alveolar, and are phonetically heterosyllabic where 
intervocalic; hence, even initial cases are analyzed as 
sequences. Many two-vowel sequences occur.
