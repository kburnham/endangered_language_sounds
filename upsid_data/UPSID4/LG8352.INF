Language name: Burarra
Language number: 8352
Alternate names: Burera
Classification: Australian, Burarran
Comments: Glasgow and Glasgow do not list a retroflex 
series but note that alveolars "have retroflexed variants 
... word initially and in consonant clusters following 
/r/" (the approximant).  The final and medial consonant 
clusters make more sense if a retroflex consonant series 
is assumed (including approximant /r/) which does not 
occur word-initially.
