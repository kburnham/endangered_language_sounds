Language name: OGBIA
Language number: 4124
Alternate names: 
Classification: Niger-Kordofanian, Cross River
Comments: Ogbia is spoken in the Rivers State, Nigeria.  
The language has two level tones.  Vowel harmony requires 
all words to contain vowels from the 'raised' set 
(i,e,o,u, and the raised low vowel 4) or from the 
'lowered' set (the remainder).  The palatal and labialized 
dental/alveolar nasals surface as nasalization of the 
vowel when followed by high front and back vowels 
respectively.
