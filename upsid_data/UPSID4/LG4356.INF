Language name: Shilha
Language number: 4356
Alternate names: 
Classification: Afro-Asiatic, Berber
Comments: The pharyngealized dental/alveolar consonants 
are described as "domal".  Applegate posits an element /:/ 
which adds "tension" to a preceding consonant and shortens 
the preceding vowel.  Other analyses would treat this as 
gemination.  All consonants except perhaps /9,w,j/ seem to 
occur geminate.
