Language name: EWONDO
Language number: 4141
Alternate names: 
Classification: Niger-Kordofanian, Bantoid
Comments: Ewondo has 3 level tones. The high vowels /i,u/ 
are "so high...that loud friction usually occurs with 
these vowels" (Redden 1979: 8). Prenasalized obstruents 
contrast with syllabic nasal + C sequences and according 
to Nnomo and Mbezele syllable boundary falls before them. 
The intuition of these native speakers that these are 
single segments is followed here.
