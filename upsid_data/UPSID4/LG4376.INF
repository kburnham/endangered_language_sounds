Language name: LAME
Language number: 4376
Alternate names: Zime
Classification: Afro-Asiatic, Chadic
Comments: Lame is spoken in Benoue Department of Cameroon 
along the Chad border.  Non-high vowels have a rounded 
schwa variant in initial syllables of some disyllables and 
reduplicated forms.  Vowels are nasalized before velar 
nasal and the nasal is dropped in some forms.  Sachnine 
(1982) suggests positing a series of nasalized vowels.  
There are 3 level tones, but strong dependence between 
initial consonants and tone in verbal forms.  Intervocalic 
voicing of obstruents is strongly influenced by initial 
voicing.
