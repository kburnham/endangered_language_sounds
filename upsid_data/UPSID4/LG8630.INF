Language name: USAN
Language number: 8630

Classification: Papuan, Trans-New Guinea
Comments: Usan is spoken in the Adelbert Ranges, Madang 
Province, Papua New Guinea. Plain and prenasalized voiced 
plosives only contrast in medial and final position., /d/ 
is [d] initially but an alveolar flap elsewhere. A 
considerable number of vowel sequences "with one mora 
timing" occur; these are interpreted nonetheless as vowel 
sequences.
