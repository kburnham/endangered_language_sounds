Language name: KALKATUNGU
Language number: 8369
Alternate names: 
Classification: Australian, Pama-Nyungan
Comments: Initially nasal + stop clusters occur; as these 
are among a larger number of medial clusters such clusters 
are not treated as prenasalized stops. Stops are 
"basically voiceless lenis stops", but voicing through 
coarticulation is normal. There is no initial contrast of 
alveolar and retroflex.
