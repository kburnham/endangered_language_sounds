Language name: Amo
Language number: 4122
Alternate names: 
Classification: Niger-Kordofanian, Plateau
Comments: Di Luzio (1972) reports a two-level tone system 
with rising and falling combinations.  Anderson (1980) 
notes downstep, and "extra high" on a few items.  A larger 
vowel inventory than either author reports is assumed on 
the basis of field work by L. Hyman and analysis of tape 
recordings.
