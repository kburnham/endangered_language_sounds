Language name: AMELE

Alternate names: 
Classification: Papuan, Trans-New Guinea
Comments: Amele is spoken between the Gum and Gogol 
rivers, just south of Madang, Papua New Guinea.  All V + V 
sequences occur but some under limited conditions; the six 
sequences beginning with a nonhigh vowel and ending with a 
high vowel are monosyllabic, the others bisyllabic.  
Stress on monomorphemic words falls on the first closed 
syllable (usually the final one) or, failing that, on the 
first syllable.  In inflected verbs and possessed nouns 
stress placement is grammatically or lexically determined.
