Classification: Australian, Garawan
Comments: Garawa is spoken in the northeast of Northern 
Territory and an adjoining area of Queensland.  The 
segments labelled palatal stop and nasal in UPSID are 
described as "lamino-velar" by Furby (1974).  They have 
lengthened vowels with an [-i] offglide preceding them and 
do not occur word-initially.  A considerable number of 
medial consonant clusters occur.  Vowels have considerable 
allophonic variation.  Stress falls on the first syllable 
of the (phonological) word.
