Language name: KANAKURU
Language number: 4370
Alternate names: 
Classification: Afro-Asiatic, Chadic
Comments: Kanakuru has a two level tone system, with 
somewhat limited contrastive function.  Newman recognizes 
7 additional labialized consonant phonemes.  As these are 
apparently identical to Cw sequences that are derived in 
Cui and Coi syllables they are interpreted as sequences 
here.
