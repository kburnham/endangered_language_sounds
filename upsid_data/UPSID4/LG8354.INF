Language name: ALAWA
Language number: 8354
Alternate names: 
Classification: Australian, Maran
Comments: Plosives vary in perceived voicing.  
Prenasalized stops can be distinguished from homorganic 
nasal + plosive on the basis of syllabification.  The 
contrast between retroflex and alveolar is limited to 
intervocalic positions.  /e/ seems to be a recent 
development from /a/.
