Language name: NERA
Language number: 4212
Alternate names: 
Classification: Nilo-Saharan, E. Sudanic
Comments: All vowels also occur long, and gemination of 
consonants is distinctive.  "At least two significant 
tones occur" (Thompson).  Voiced prenasalized stops occur 
and velars also occur labialized.  Thompson treats these 
as sequences but does not provide a reasoning.  Bender 
(1968) notes that these are among a longer list of 
word-medial clusters.
