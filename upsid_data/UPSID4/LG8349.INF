Language name: MURINHPATHA
Language number: 8349
Alternate names: 
Classification: Australian, ungrouped
Comments: Murinhpatha is still spoken by a substantial 
community mainly at Wadeye (Port Keats), Northern 
Territory, Australia.  Street and Mollinjin's articulatory 
diagrams show that the dental series is interdental before 
non-front vowels /a,U/ but laminal post-alveolar (with 
tongue tip behind the lower teeth) before front vowels.  
This distribution seems to argue for this series being 
underlying dental, rather than being (lamino-)palatal as 
they suggest.  The palatal variant is thus due to a front 
vowel position.  However, this does not account for 
palatal variants occurring in syllable-final position.  
Retroflex consonants do not occur word-initially.  /j/ 
occurs word-finally after vowels other than /i/.  Primary 
stress is normally on the first syllable, with alternating 
stresses on subsequent syllables.
