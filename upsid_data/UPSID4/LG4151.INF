Language name: LUA
Language number: 4151
Alternate names: Niellim
Classification: Niger-Kordofanian, Adamawa
Comments: Lua is spoken along the middle reaches of the 
Chari river, Chad. Prenasalized stops occur initially in a 
few words but medially could be allophones of voiced stops 
after nasalized vowels. Implosives are realized as ? + 
nasal before nasalized vowels, but oral and nasalized 
vowels contrast after plosives. Boyeldieu (1985) 
recognizes complex vowels /wa, ja/ - these are interpreted 
as vowel sequences /ua,ia/. All vowels except 'barred i' 
appear long and short.
