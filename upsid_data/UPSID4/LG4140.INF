Language name: GWARI
Language number: 4140
Alternate names: Gbari, Gbagyi
Classification: Niger-Kordofanian, Kwa
Comments: Gwari has 3 level tones.  Hyman and Magaji note 
that "one distinctive characteristic of all Gwari dialects 
is the presence of consonant + nasal clusters".  An 
alternative would be to posit 3 nasalized vowels, but H & 
M's analysis is accepted here, since C + N + /a/ is 
realized as consonant + nasal release + oral vowel [a].  
High vowels /i,u/ after C + N are phonetically nasalized, 
and C + N + /i/ only has a phonetic nasal consonant 
segment if C is bilabial or velar.  A loose end is a 
grammatical particle (orthographic 'in') which is a 
nasalized vowel only.  /t,d,s,z/ are palato-alveolar 
affricates and fricatives before front vowels or /j/.  /n/ 
is palatal before /j/ and velar before /w/.
