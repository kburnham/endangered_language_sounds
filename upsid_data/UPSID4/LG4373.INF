Classification: Afro-Asiatic, Chadic
Comments: Mandage or Magalbe dialect.  Kotoko is spoken 
to the south of Lake Chad in the Nigeria-Cameroun-Chad 
border region. Kotoko is tonal, with 60% of all items 
low-toned. Extra high tone has limited distribution, a 
low-falling tone occurs only in final syllables. Bouny's 
analysis is tentative on several points. Higher mid and 
lower mid vowels may turn out to be predictable variants. 
Many consonant clusters including geminate plosives occur 
medially and are interpreted as heterosyllabic but 
sonorants can appear long syllable-finally. Bouny treats 
the voiceless ejective affricates as consonant sequences 
but they can appear initially and as C2 in -VC1C2V- where 
they initiate the second syllable.  They also complete an 
ejective series which is otherwise missing labial and 
coronal terms. On the other hand, prenasalized stops 
intervocalically are divided VN.CV and so are treated here 
as sequences even in initial position.
