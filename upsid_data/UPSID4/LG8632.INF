Classification: Papuan, Sepik-Ramu
Comments: Yessan-Mayo is spoken upriver from Ambunti, East 
Sepik Province, Papua New Guinea. Stress is initial except 
when /a/ occurs in a subsequent syllable and attracts 
stress to that syllable. Vowel allophones are very 
variable. Rounded allophones of central vowels occur 
before and after /w/ and after labialized velars. Fronted 
allophones occur contiguous to /i/ and, often, with 
bilabials.
