Language name: WARAY
Language number: 8348
Alternate names: 
Classification: Australian, ungrouped
Comments: Waray was formerly spoken in the area around 
Adelaide River, south of Darwin, Northern Territory, 
Australia.  Harvey (1987) notes that unitary long 
consonants contrast with sequences of identical 
consonants.  Short stops are shown as voiced after nasals, 
and optionally, between vowels.  When intervocalic they 
may become approximants, or in the case of /t/ a tap.
