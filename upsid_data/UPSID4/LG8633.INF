Language name: WOISIKA
Language number: 8633
Alternate names: 
Classification: Papuan, Trans-New Guinea
Comments: Woisika is spoken in the center of the island of 
Alor, Nusa Tenggara Timur, Indonesia. Because Stokhof 
(1979) places 'w' on his chart of symbols in the 
labiodental column it is assumed the sound is labiodental. 
The vowels are described by Stokhof as divided into 
"tense" and "lax" sets. The "tense" vowels are usually 
lower, more peripheral and longer than the "lax" vowels 
and also are lower in pitch. "Lax" vowels, except for /a/, 
are more common than their nearest "tense" counterparts. 
The features available in UPSID require some compromises 
in vowel representation.  Retracted front high and fronted 
back high vowels are represented here as central, although 
Stokhof marks them as halfway between center and 
periphery.  Similarly, a retracted central low unrounded 
vowel is shown as back here.  Palatograms included in the 
book show clearly dental articulation for /t, d, n/ etc. 
but Stokhof indicates variation to alveolar place.
