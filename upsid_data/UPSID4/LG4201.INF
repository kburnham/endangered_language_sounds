Language name: KANURI
Language number: 4201
Alternate names: 
Classification: Nilo-Saharan, Saharan
Comments: Kanuri has a two-level tone system.  Hutchison 
lists prenasalized stops as unit phonemes but does not 
justify this assumption, however Awoboluyi gives an 
example suggesting that closed syllable allophones of mid 
vowels appear before N + C clusters.
