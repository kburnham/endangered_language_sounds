Language name: JOMANG
Language number: 4142
Alternate names: Talodi
Classification: Niger-Kordofanian, Kordofanian
Comments: Jomang has two level tones, falling tone has 
been noted in word-final position. All continuants except 
/n/ and /w/ are reported as geminates in Schadeberg's 
data. He notes voiced and voiceless stops, but they can be 
analyzed as only one series, voiced when single and 
voiceless when geminate this interpretation is preferred.
