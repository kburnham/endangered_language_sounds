Language name: YOLNGU
Language number: 8375
Alternate names: Dhangu
Classification: Australian, Pama-Nyungan
Comments: Djapu dialect.  Yolngu is spoken in north-east 
Arnhem Land, Northern Territory, Australia.  Stops have 
both voiced and voiceless allophones but intervocalically 
they are voiceless in the tape recording prepared by Rose 
and Morphy, hence are interpreted as voiceless.  Glottal 
stops in final position are partially predictable but 
contrasts occur.  Alveolar consonants rarely occur 
word-initially (and then mostly in loanwords); dental 
consonants do not occur word-finally.  Vowels in 
word-initial syllables have contrastive length; single 
following consonants after contrastively short vowels tend 
to be long.
