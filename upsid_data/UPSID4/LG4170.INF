Comments: Toro Soo dialect.  Dogon is spoken in an area 
straddling the Mali-Burkina Faso border to the east of 
Mopti.  Higher and lower mid vowels do not co-occur in a 
stem.  Dogon has been analyzed as a tone language with two 
level tones but words have only LH or HL basic patterns 
and the pitch could be predicted from accent.
