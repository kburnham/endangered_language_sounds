Language name: IRAQW
Language number: 4360
Alternate names: 
Classification: Afro-Asiatic, Cushitic
Comments: Whitely implies that the voiced implosives may 
be contrastive morphophonologically but Chris Ehret (p.c.) 
considers them as free variants of voiced plosives.  
Non-low central vowels may be derived, leaving a 
five-vowel long/short basic system.  Iraqw probably has a 
two-level tone system.
