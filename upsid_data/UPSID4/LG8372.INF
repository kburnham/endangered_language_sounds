Classification: Australian, Pama-Nyungan
Comments: Vowels occur both long and short. Long mid 
vowels occur but are analyzed as vowel-glide-vowel,   
/aji/ -> [e:] etc. Stops are "occasionally voiced 
medially". Initially alveolar stops and nasals don't 
occur, and dental and palatal stops and nasals (the 
"laminals") are largely predictable variants (dental 
initially, medially mostly predictable from vowel 
environment).
