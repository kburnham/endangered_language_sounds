Language name: VANIMO
Language number: 8640
Alternate names: 
Classification: Papuan, Sko
Comments: Dumo dialect.  Vanimo is spoken in an area on 
the northern coast of Papua New Guinea near the Irian Jaya 
border.  Ross (1980) describes it as having 3 "tones": 
"high", "long", and "toneless".  Long tone is apparently 
not perceptibly longer "because Vanimo has strict 
syllable-timing" but it has a mid onset.  The 
palato-alveolar stop has affricate and approximant 
variants.  Ross considers it posible that nasalized vowels 
could be allophonic but conditioning is not understood.
