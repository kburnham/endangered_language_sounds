Comments: "The principal members of the stop phones are 
voiceless, although there are voiced allophones for all 
five" (Metcalfe 1971).  Retroflex plosives and nasals do 
not occur word-initially; retroflex /r./ does occur 
initially but alveolar /r/ doesn't.  Establishment of a 
length contrast in vowels is tentative.
