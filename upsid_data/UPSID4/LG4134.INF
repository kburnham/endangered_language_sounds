Language name: AGHEM
Language number: 4134
Alternate names: 
Classification: Niger-Kordofanian, Bantoid
Comments: Aghem has two level tones.  A falling tone is 
derived when high spreads to a following low tone 
syllable.  Long vowels and diphthongs seem best treated as 
vowel sequences.  They carry a single tone but often 
derive from affixation or loss of intervocalic consonants.  
Phonetic [p] is analyzed as the allophone of /kp/ before 
[u].
