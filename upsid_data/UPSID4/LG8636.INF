Alternate names: 
Classification: Papuan, Trans-New Guinea
Comments: Island Kiwai dialect.  Island Kiwai is spoken on 
Kiwai Island and some nearby areas in the Fly River delta, 
Western Province, Papua New Guinea.  Wurm (1977) reports 
that vowel length is absent but that VV and V + diphthong 
clusters occur.  A vowel harmony system is present which 
"affects the vowels of affixes, especially prefixes" but 
no details are given.  There is a complex stress system 
and two tones but the functional load of the tonal 
contrast is low.  All syllables are open and no consonant 
clusters occur.
