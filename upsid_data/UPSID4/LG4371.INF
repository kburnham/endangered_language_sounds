Language name: KERA
Language number: 4371
Alternate names: 
Classification: Afro-Asiatic, Chadic 
Comments: In open syllables there is a contrast between 
long and short vowels. Ebert notes ten words with 
nasalized vowels. We have interpreted these as having a 
palatal nasal -- medially this varies with nasalized /j/, 
finally it is lost leaving a nasalized vowel. Kera has 3 
level tones and glides composed of their combination. 
There is a strong interrelationship between tone level and 
obstruent consonant voicing (laryngealized stops go with 
voiceless ones).
