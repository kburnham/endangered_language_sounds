Karawari rivers, E. Sepik province, Papua New Guinea. 
Palato-alveolar consonants often arise from blending of an 
alveolar + preceding or following /j/. Nonsibilant 
fricatives are voiced between voiced segments, except when 
a nasal precedes. An analysis of the vowel system as 
containing only 3 central vowels, with front and back 
variants conditioned by adjacent approximants /j/, /w/ is 
discussed by Bruce (1984). However there are several 
problems with this analysis, e.g. [i] from abstract high 
central vowel + /j/ would be expected to palatalize a 
following /t/ but doesn't.
