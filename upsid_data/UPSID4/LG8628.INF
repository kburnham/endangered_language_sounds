Classification: Papuan, Trans-New Guinea
Comments: Wahgi is spoken in the Central Highlands of 
Papua New Guinea. It is analyzed as having word-level 
high, low and rising tone patterns and also stress 
(Phillips 1976). The i/I contrast seems marginal and may 
depend on tone. Laterals do not occur word-initially and 
are voiceless fricatives or affricates finally; Phillips 
reports them as varying with voiced fricatives medially. 
Ladefoged, Cochran and Disner (1977) report voiced lateral 
approximants in medial position.
