Language name: MAMBILA
Language number: 4153
Alternate names: 
Classification: Niger-Kordofanian, Bantoid
Comments: Atta dialect.  Mambila is spoken on and near the 
Mambila plateau straddling the Nigeria-Cameroon border.  
Perrin & Hill (1969) analyze the tone system as consisting 
of four level tones which can combine to form two rising, 
two falling, and one rise-fall contour on monosyllables.  
A form of vowel harmony restricts sequences of vowels in 
disyllables.  Any vowel except /a/ can follow itself; only 
/e/ follows /a/.  Also /a/ can follow /i,e,u/, /e/ can 
follow /i,u/ and /i/ can follow /u/.  Vowels are nasalized 
after /h/.
