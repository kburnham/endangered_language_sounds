Language name: YANYUWA
Language number: 8347
Alternate names: Anyula, Yanyula
Classification: Australian, Ungrouped
Comments: Yanyuwa is spoken mainly at or near Borroloola, 
Northern Territory, Australia.  The series of consonants 
described here as palatalized velars are called 
palato-velar by Kirton and Charlie (1978).  They arose 
historically through coalescence of clusters of 
palato-alveolar and velar consonants.  Almost all 
remaining clusters consist of a sequence of a coronal and 
a 'peripheral' (bilabial or velar), so an analysis of 
these as clusters would be defensible (Huttar and Kirton, 
1981).  The velar and palatalized velar series do not 
contrast between high front vowels.  Stops are said to 
vary in voicing with a tendency for "voicing to be more 
frequent between vowels and at the onset of a stressed 
syllable in word-medial position" (Kirton 1967:18).  
However, a tape recording of one Yanyuwa speaker showed 
voiceless stops even in these positions.  Kirton and 
Charlie (1978) note that for prenasalized stops in 
word-initial position "the nasal onset of the complex 
phoneme is voiceless in almost every occurrence".  This is 
taken as an indication that the prenasalized stops are 
also basically voiceless.  /a/ is the most common vowel; 
the sequence /aa/ is disyllabic and no other vowel 
sequences occur.
