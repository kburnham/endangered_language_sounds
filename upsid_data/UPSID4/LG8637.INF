Classification: Papuan, Trans-New Guinea
Comments: Waris is spoken in Amanab District, West Sepik 
Province, Papua New Guinea, and adjoining areas of Irian 
Jaya, Indonesia.  Brown (1988) provides only a list of 
phoneme symbols with few definitions.  /a/ is described as 
low front but seems more likely to be central as there are 
two other vowels in the lower front region.
