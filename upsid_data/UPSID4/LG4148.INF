Language name: FE?FE?

Alternate names: 
Classification: Niger-Kordofanian, Bantoid
Comments: Fe?fe? is spoken in the Haut-Nkam department of 
Cameroun. The inventory given corresponds to the 
underlying segments proposed by Hyman (1972). Voiced stops 
only appear as such following nasal prefixes; elsewhere 
they are voiceless stops or voiced sonorants (/d/->[l]). 
Vowels have generally more open variants in closed 
syllables. As with segments, the tones of Fe?fe? show 
considerable surface variation which can be reduced to a 
small number of underlying contrast, essentially high and 
low levels.
