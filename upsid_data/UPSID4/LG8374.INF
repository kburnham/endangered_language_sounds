Language name: NGARINJIN
Language number: 8374
Alternate names: Ungarinjin
Classification: Australian, Wororan
Comments: Ngarinjin is spoken in the Northern Kimberley 
Ranges of northern Western Australia. Coate and Elkin's 
description of sounds is often variable: the palatals are 
labeled "palato-dental" (except "alveolar" /j/) on the 
consonant chart but just as palatals when listed 
individually; /l/ is "alveolar" on the chart but 
"alveo-velar" in the list. Symbols for plosives suggest 
voiced segments, but they are defined as voiceless. Vowels 
apparently may appear long. A high central vowel is added 
to the five vowels given by Coates and Elkin on the basis 
of a remark that this vowel is heard in some words and is 
"differentiated by some linguists in Ngarinjin".
