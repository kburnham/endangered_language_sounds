Classification: Niger-Kordofanian, Bantoid
Comments: Western dialect.  Ejagham is spoken in an area 
along the Nigeria-Cameroon border near Ikom.  There are 
three level tones and three contours (high-low, high-mid, 
low-high), at least on the surface.  There are few roots 
with contrast of /d/ and flap /r/, or /b/ and bilabial 
fricative; usually these are predictable variants.
