Language name: TIWI
Language number: 8351
Alternate names: 
Classification: Australian, ungrouped
Comments: Retroflex consonants (except the rhotic) do not 
occur initially.  Lee (1984) suggests that labialization 
of consonants can be predicted from occurrence of the 
vowel /o/.  Other analyses have proposed distinctive 
labialized bilabial and velar consonants.
