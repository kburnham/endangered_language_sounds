Alternate names: 
Classification: Niger-Kordofanian, West Atlantic
Comments: Ndut is spoken in Mont-Rolland, northwest of 
Thies in Senegal. The language appears to have 3 level 
tones. Consonant inventory has been inferred from the 
examples cited in Gueye (1986); some contrasts might have 
been missed. Velar and dental/alveolar prenasalized stops 
are assumed to occur although no examples are cited. The 
vowel system opposes [+ATR] i, e, u and schwa to the 
remainging [-ATR] vowels.
