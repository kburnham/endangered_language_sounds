Classification: Niger-Kordofanian, Kwa
Comments: Uzere dialect. Isoko is spoken around the town 
of Oleh in Bendel State, Nigeria. Isoko has two level 
tones; final L is raised in affirmative declaratives. The 
vowels /i,e,o,u/ belong to one harmony set (+ATR) in 
opposition to the remainder. A word must have vowels from 
one set or the other, except that /a/ may appear in 
prefixes before [+ATR] vowels. Clusters with the flap 
occur, including h + flap r which has been interpreted as 
a voiceless flap by others. Breathy voiced 'v' is tending 
to lose its distinctive phonation and merge with /v/.
