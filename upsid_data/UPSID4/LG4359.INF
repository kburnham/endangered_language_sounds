Language name: AWIYA
Language number: 4359
Alternate names: Awngi
Classification: Afro-Asiatic, Cushitic
Comments: "Length is relevant for consonants, but geminate 
consonants occur relatively seldom." (Hetzron)  'Ash' can 
be derived from "a palatal element and /a/ at a morpheme 
boundary" but some forms are fossilized and can be cited 
to justify the 6-vowel analysis.  Probably tonal.
