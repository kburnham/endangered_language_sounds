Language name: Moro
Language number: 4101
Alternate names: 
Classification: Niger-Kordofanian, Kordofanian
Comments: The Blacks consider a number of syllable-initial 
nasal+stop and liquid+stop clusters to be unit phonemes.  
Voiced dental and retroflex stops seem to be limited to 
occurrence in these clusters.  Schadeberg treats [6D] as 
an allophone of /dD/.
