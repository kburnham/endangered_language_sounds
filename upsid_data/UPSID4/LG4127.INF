Language name: TEKE
Language number: 4127
Alternate names: Kukuya
Classification: Niger-Kordofanian, Bantoid
Comments: Stops and affricates also occur prenasalized but 
many of these occurrences result from prefixation, so all 
are analyzed as biphonemic; /g/ only occurs with a 
preceding nasal.  The highest vowels /i, u/ occur 
distinctively only as first vowel in a CVV sequence and 
introduce fricative transitions on the preceding C.
