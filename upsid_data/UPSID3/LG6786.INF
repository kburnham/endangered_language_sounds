Language name: HIGHLAND CHINANTEC
Language number: 6786
Alternate names: 
Classification: Northern American, Oto-Manguean
Comments: Quiotepec dialect. Highland Chinantec is spoken 
in Ixtlan district, Oaxaca, Mexico. Robbins (1968) 
analyzes it as having three level tones and stress. 
Syllables with short vowels have only one tone. Syllables 
with long vowels can have rising and falling combinations 
of these levels. The only syllable-final consonant is /?/. 
Oral and nasalized vowels occur after voiceless 
obstruents, but nasal consonants and prenasalized stops 
are in complementary distribution. This is interpreted as 
'oralization' of nasals before oral vowels (i.e. 
/ma/=[mba] etc.) Clusters of /?/ + nasal or /w, j/ occur 
but all other clusters posited by Robbins have been 
interpreted as single segments. Note especially his 'hg' 
is interpreted as the voiceless velar nasal. Phonetically 
he transcribes it as a prenasalized stop with a voiceless 
nasal onset and although he says that 'h' can "precede any 
nasal" there are no examples of 'h' before 'eng' anywhere 
in his grammar.
