Classification: N. American, Almosan
Comments: Bella Coola is spoken by perhaps 75 remaining 
fluent speakers in Bella Coola on the central coast of 
British Columbia. Reduplication rules that copy a single 
consonant clarify that the ejectives and affricates listed 
are not clusters. High vowels alternate with /w,j/. 
Syllabic instances of /m,n,l/ (phonetically shwa before 
sonorant) are largely predictable from phonological and 
morphological context.
