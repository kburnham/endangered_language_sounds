Alternate names: Sm'algyax
Classification: N. American, Penutian
Comments: Coast Tsimshian is spoken along the British 
Columbia coast adjacent to the border with Alaska. The 
system presented here is primarily based on Mulder's 
(1988) interpretation of Dunn's grammar and dictionary. 
Voiced and voiceless plosives are largely in complementary 
distribution, voiced ones occurring immediately before a 
voiced sonorant or vowel and voiceless ones in final 
position and in clusters elsewhere. However, exceptions to 
this pattern occur often enough that obstruent voicing 
must be treated as contrastive. It is not clear if plain 
velar stops are distinctive; Dunn implies that either a 
w-offglide or a j-offglide accompanies every velar stop 
but many examples are written without an offglide. Mulder 
interprets occurrence of "plain velars before rounded 
vowels" as evidence for three velar series, but it could 
be that consonant rounding is redundant in this context 
and these are instances of labialized velars. Both Mulder 
and Dunn recognise a larger inventory of vowels than Hoard 
(1978) does for closely-related Gitksan. Phonetic vowel 
quality seems strongly influenced by consonant environment 
and stress, but full details are not worked out. Only 
three vowels, which occur long and short, are assumed to 
be underlying.
