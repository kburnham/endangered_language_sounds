Alternate names: 
Classification: North American, Keresiouan, Iroquoian
Comments: North Carolina dialect.  Cherokee is spoken in 
parts of eastern  Oklahoma and also in western North 
Carolina. Clusters of /h/ + voiced consonant are 
phonetically voiceless counterparts of the voiced C. Such 
clusters often arise from a metathesis process switching 
/h, ?/ and a resonant. A more superficial account might 
posit a whole set of voiceless consonants.
