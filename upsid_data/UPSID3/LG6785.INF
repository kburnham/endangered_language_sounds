Language name: KIOWA
Language number: 6785
Alternate names: 
Classification: North American, Kiowa-Tanoan
Comments: Kiowa is spoken by a few hundred speakers in 
south-central Oklahoma. Long and short variants of vowels 
occur, with many alternations predictable from syllable 
structure (Long in open, short in closed syllables). Kiowa 
has high and low tones and a HL combination that occurs 
only on heavy syllables (containing a long vowel, a 
diphthong or a vowel + sonorant sequence). HL is 
accompanied by significant glottalization. /dl/ does not 
occur initially; medially it is [l]. Dental and alveolar 
obstruents do not occur before /i/; velars and /j/ do not 
occur before /e/. A palatal glide is clearly heard between 
a velar and front /a/.
