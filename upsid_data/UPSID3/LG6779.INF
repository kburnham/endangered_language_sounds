Comments: Southern Sierra Miwok used to be spoken in 
Mariposa county, California. In the 1960's there were 
about 20 speakers living. Stops vary between voiced and 
voiceless intervocalically. Consonants may be long - 
Freeland (1951) says geminates only occur medially but 
Broadbent (1965) indicates they also occur finally.
