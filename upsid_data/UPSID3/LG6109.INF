Language name: EYAK
Language number: 6109
Alternate names: 
Classification: Na-Dene, Eyak
Comments: Krauss (1965) reported that there were "3 
persons capable of serving adequately as informants for 
Eyak".  Apart from loanwords /m,n/ "could be interpreted 
as w and l respectively, followed by a nasalized vowel".  
Short oral vowels are often in free variation, the 
non-high vowel variation being obscurely described.  
Krauss includes 'aspiration' and 'glottalization' of 
vowels as modifications similar to length and 
nasalization.  Since there are consonants /h,?/, and verb 
stems in -V:? ("long glottalized nucleus") seem to count 
as closed, these are interpreted as postvocalic -h and -?.
