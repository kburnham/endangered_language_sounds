Language name: TOL
Language number: 6747
Alternate names: Jicaque
Classification: N. American, Hokan
Comments: Tol is spoken by a few hundred people in the 
Francisco Morazon department of Honduras.  Fleming & 
Dennis (1977) recognize a segment described as a central 
semivowel (velar approximant?) which occurs only as an 
infix.  This seems likely to be considered an allophone 
either of the corresponding vowel or one of the other 
approximants.  Glottalized stops occur with laryngealized 
vowels in the same syllable -- an alternative analysis 
might posit laryngealized vowels but it appears that 
syllable-initial and syllable-final glottalized stops need 
to be distinguished.
