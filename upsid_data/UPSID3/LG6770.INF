Language name: AMUZGO
Language number: 6770
Alternate names: 
Classification: N. American, Oto-Manguean
Comments: Amuzgo contrasts ballistic and controlled 
syllables.  Ballistic syllables have sharply falling pitch 
and amplitude contours.  It also has three level tones and 
high-low, mid-high and low-mid contour tones.  The 
prenasalized stops are described as occluded 
(post-stopped) nasals with a "lenis" homorganic stop.  
They contrast with nasal + stop sequences.  A possible 
analysis (not among those suggested by Bauernschmidt) is 
to treat these as allophones of the plain nasals before 
oral vowels since the oral/nasalized vowel contrast is 
neutralized after a nasal.  This would mean that a velar 
nasal would only occur before an oral vowel, so it is not 
accepted here.  Bilabials and t,n are described as 
velarized.
