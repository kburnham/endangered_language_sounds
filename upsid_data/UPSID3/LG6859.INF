Language name: QAWASQAR
Language number: 6859
Alternate names: Alakaluf
Classification: South American, Andean
Comments: Qawasqar is spoken by a small number of 
survivors (47 in 1977) on Wellington island near the 
Straits of Magellen, Chile. Sounds described as 
'glottalized' have been interpreted as ejectives; Clairis 
remarks that they are 'unstable'. 'Apical' has been 
interpreted as alveolar. The vowels are described as being 
highly variable, apparently in an unconditioned way. Some 
words vary markedly in their vocalization. Stress is 
normally penultimate.
