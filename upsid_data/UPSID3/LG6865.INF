Comments: Trumai is spoken in the upper Xingu basin, Mato 
Grosso, Brazil. Stress is on the ultimate syllable of a 
root but is displaced onto a monosyllabic suffix. Nasals 
occur both voiced and voiceless but not contrastively, 
however the bilabial is reported to be much more frquently 
voiceless than the dental one.
