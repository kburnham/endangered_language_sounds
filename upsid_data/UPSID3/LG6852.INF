Language name: WARAO
Language number: 6852
Alternate names: 
Classification: S. American, Paezan
Comments: Warao is spoken principally along the Venezuelan 
coast from the Orinoco delta to the Guyana border. Osborn 
(1966) lists /p/ rather /b/ as the bilabial stop phoneme, 
but reports that "the voiced allopyhone [b] is heard more 
frequently than the voiceless [p]". /t/ "has the allophone 
[t] in all positions". The alveolar lateral flap occurs as 
[d] word-initially and as a nonlateral flap before /a/ 
when preceded by /i,a/. Nasalized vowels occur mostly . 
Nasality spreads from a nasal consonant to all following 
vowels and glides between the nasal and a following 
obstruent or word-boundary but a number of words also have 
unconditioned nasalized vowels.
