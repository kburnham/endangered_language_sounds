Language name: ACHE
Language number: 6866
Alternate names: Guayaki
Classification: South American, Equatorial
Comments: Ache is spoken by a very small group of 
surviving speakers in the Alta Pou reservation, Alto 
Parana, Paraguay.  Susnik's description is quite 
unorthodox and leaves somewhat unclear exactly what 
consonants and vowels are contrastive.  In particular 
nasalized vowels seem often predictable if prenasalized 
stops and /m/ are assumed to be underlying.  However, the 
analysis adopted here assumes that they are contrastive 
because a few are cited in words with voiceless stops.  On 
the other hand [n] is taken to be an allophone of the 
lateral flap.
