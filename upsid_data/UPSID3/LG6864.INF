Language name: CACUA
Language number: 6864
Alternate names: 
Classification: South American, Macro-Tucanoan
Comments: Cacua is spoken along tributaries of the Vaupes 
and Papuri rivers in the Vaupes region, Colombia. The 
language is tonal with two levels. Cathcart (1979) 
suggests that tonal distribution is better analyzed over a 
"foot"; four patterns contrast, HL, HHL, LH, L. A foot is 
usually one syllable, but may be up to 3 syllables. The 
segments analyzed as nasals here appear as nasals before 
or after a nasalized vowel, otherwise as prenasalized 
stops in word-initial position and medially after a 
nasalized vowel and /h, ?/, as prestopped nasals in final 
position, and as voiced plosives in other medial 
positions. Cathcart analyzes these segments as voiced 
stops, but the nasality in marginal positions is better 
accounted for if these are nasals which denasalize 
adjacent to an oral vowel (or consonant in medial 
environments).
