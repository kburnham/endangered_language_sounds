Language name: SHUSWAP

Alternate names: 
Classification: N. American, Almosan
Comments: Spoken by older people in an area of 
southcentral British Columbia, Canada. Schwa only appears 
in unstressed syllables. Kuipers (1974) notes that "in the 
glottalic obstruents glottal and release are 
simultaneous", hence these are not interpreted as ejective 
or implosive.
