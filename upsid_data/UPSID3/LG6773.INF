Classification: N. American, Almosan
Comments: Upper Chehalis was formerly spoken in an area of 
South-western Washington state, U.S.A. Vowel length is 
phonemic. There may be a series of contrastively 
laryngealized nasals and approximants, but Kinkade's 
(1963) subject was not consistent in using them.
