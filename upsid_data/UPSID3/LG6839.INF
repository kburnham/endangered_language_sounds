Language name: YAGUA
Language number: 6839
Alternate names: 
Classification: S. American, Macro-Carib
Comments: Payne states that /p, m/ are often labialized 
[pw, mw] and /m, n/ are prenasalized stops before oral 
vowels. It is not clear if this means that [mbw] is 
normally found. On the assumption that prenasalization is 
optional the nasal segments are anayzed as nasal /m, n/. 
Yagua has basically a two-level tone system. Other 
analyses suggest the mid vowels might be derived from 
vowel coalescence, Payne describes these as phonemes with 
defective distribution.
