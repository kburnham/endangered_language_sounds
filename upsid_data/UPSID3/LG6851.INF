  Language name: ANDOKE

Alternate names: 
Classification: S. American, Macro-Carib
Comments: Andoke is spoken in the upper Amazon basin in 
Colombia. Landaburu analyses it as a tone language with 
two level tones. Nasalized vowels occur word-initially, 
but elsewhere only after nasal consonants. Consequently 
nasals can be analyzed as allohpones of voiced stops. The 
sounds represented as palato-alveolar affricates here 
apparently vary considerably from (palatal) plosives, to 
(postalveolar) affricates, to [s] and [j] for voiceless 
and voiced cases respectively. Syllables may be closed by 
a glottal stop - Landaburu treats this as a feature of the 
vowels.
