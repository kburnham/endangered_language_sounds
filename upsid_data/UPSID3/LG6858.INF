Classification: South American, Macro-Ge
Comments: Maxakali is spoken in northeastern Minas Gerais 
state, Brazil. Prenasalized stops, except the velar one, 
lose their stop component before nasalized vowels. The 
voiceless affricate is often just a fricative. 
Syllable-final consonants can be replaced by a "cognate 
vowel" especially when followed by a homorganic consonant.
