utterance initially or following a nasalized vowel. 
Preceding a nasalized vowel they are nasal consonants 
(/b/->[m], etc.). The vowels /e,o,a/ are all classed as 
"low" but on the basis of symbols chosen it is assumed 
/e,o/ are mid vowels. Cubeo has two level tones and 
stress, which may only fall on a high-tone syllable.
