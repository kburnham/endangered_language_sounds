Comments: Yucatec is spoken in parts of the Yucatan 
peninsula of Mexico. The version of Yucatec represented 
here is an extremely 'nonhispanicized' one, lacking loan 
segments found in other varieties. Yucatec has a two level 
tone system. Straight posits two laterals and two 'n's 
based on different behavior in word-final position; only 
one of each is included here.
